# big_project
=== Description ===
The code is set-up in a way that makes the process linear instead of
modular by functions using jupyter notebooks. After each step - code block - the results are
saved in the project directory/checkpoints to prevent unnecessary repetitions.

Averaging the entire 30 seconds of each condition, 2 conditions per emotion group (positive/negative)
then averaging across 40 subjects - allows the basic full-brain t-tests more statistically significant. 

MEG and EEG couldn't have given accurate subcortical reading which is most correlated with emotion.
Then using fMRI for this question is ideal. Also, it saves the trouble of the inverse problem faced by those two methods.
